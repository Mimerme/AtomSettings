You'll want to pick a UI theme that looks good with your syntax theme. The defaults aren't bad, though.\n\nYou can override the defaults in the package settings. Use the package names of the syntax and UI themes (ex: `unity-ui`).\n\nKeymapped to `F12` by default.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/al3x/atom-theme-switcher/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/al3x/atom-theme-switcher","_id":"theme-switcher@1.1.0","_shasum":"3545c21ea2a55e6b3da9de31bc2a4c87d2c4b3f1","_resolved":"file:..\\d-115219-42680-11vq6qr\\package.tgz","_from":"..\\d-115219-42680-11vq6qr\\package.tgz"}
